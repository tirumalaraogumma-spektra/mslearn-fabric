# Exercise 4: Use notebooks to train a model in Microsoft Fabric

### Estimated Duration: 70 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll build a machine learning workflow in Microsoft Fabric using notebooks. You'll begin by uploading churn data into a lakehouse and creating a notebook. Then, you’ll load the data into a dataframe and train classification models using Scikit-Learn. With MLflow integration, you’ll track experiments, compare model performance, and visualize results. Finally, you'll save the best-performing model and end the Spark session to complete the development cycle.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Upload files into the lakehouse
- Task 2: Create a notebook
- Task 3: Load data into a dataframe
- Task 4: Train a machine learning model
- Task 5: Use MLflow to search and view your experiments
- Task 6: Explore your experiments
- Task 7: Save the model
- Task 8: Save the notebook and end the Spark session

## Task 1: Upload files into the lakehouse

2. In the New Item panel, search for **Notebook (1)** and select **Notebook (2)** from the result.

    ![](./Images/E1T5S2.png)

1. In the **New Notebook** window, keep the default notebook **Name (1)** unchanged, and then click **Create (2)** to continue.

    ![](./Images/upfab-ric-ex1-g34.png)

1. After a few seconds, a new notebook containing a single *cell* will open. Notebooks are made up of one or more cells that can contain *code* or *markdown* (formatted text).

1. Select the first cell (which is currently a *code* cell), and then in the dynamic toolbar at its top-right, use the **M&#8595;** button to convert the cell to a *markdown* cell.

    ![](./Images/E4T2S5.png)

1. When the cell changes to a markdown cell, the text it contains is rendered.

1. Use the **&#128393;** button to switch the cell to editing mode, then delete the content and enter the following text:

    ```text
   # Train a machine learning model and track with MLflow

   Use the code in this notebook to train and track models.
    ```    

## Task 3: Load data into a dataframe

In this task, you will load data into a dataframe to prepare for model training. Dataframes in Spark, akin to Pandas dataframes in Python, offer a structured way to work with data in rows and columns, enabling efficient data manipulation and analysis.

1. In the Explorer pane, Click **Add data items (1)** drop-down under explorer and select **From OneLake catalog (2)**.

    ![](./Images/E1T5P5.png) 
    
1. Select the lakehouse named **Lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** and click **Add (2)**.
 
    ![](./Images/E4T3S2.png)

1. Once after connecting to the existing lakehouse, we should be able to see the **Lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** under **Data Items**.
   
   ![](./Images/e4t3p3.png)

1. Click the **Files (1)** folder so that the CSV file is listed next to the notebook editor.

1. Right click on **churn.csv (2)**, and click on **Load data (3)** and then select **Pandas (4)**.

    ![](./Images/e4t3p4.png)

1.  A new code cell containing the following code should be added to the notebook:

    ```Python
    import pandas as pd
    # Load data into pandas DataFrame from "/lakehouse/default/" + "Files/churn.csv"
    df = pd.read_csv("/lakehouse/default/" + "Files/churn.csv")
    display(df)
    ```

    > **Note:** You can hide the pane containing the files on the left by using its **<<** icon. Doing so will help you focus on the notebook.

1. Use the **&#9655; Run cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.

    ![](./Images/e4t3s7.png)

    > **Note:** If the Spark session doesn't start or you get an error, click on the **Run all** button on the ribbon to restart the Spark session.
    
    > **Note:** Since this is the first time you've run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first run in the session can take a minute or so to complete. Subsequent runs will be quicker.

1. When the cell command has been completed, review the output below the cell, which should look similar to this:

    ![](./Images/output.png)

1. The output shows the rows and columns of customer data from the churn.csv file.

## Task 4: Train a machine learning model

In this task, you will train a machine learning model to predict customer churn using the prepared data. Utilizing the Scikit-Learn library, you'll train the model and track its performance with MLflow to ensure effective monitoring and evaluation.

1. Use the **+ Code (1)** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following **code (2)** in it:

    ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   print("Splitting dataEllipses")
   X, y = df[['years_with_company','total_day_calls','total_eve_calls','total_night_calls','total_intl_calls','average_call_minutes','total_customer_service_calls','age']].values, df['churn'].values
   
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)
    ```

1. **Run (3)** the code cell you added, and note you're omitting 'CustomerID' from the dataset, and splitting the data into a training and test dataset.

    ![](./Images/sklearn.png)

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code in it, and run it:
    
    ```python
   import mlflow
   experiment_name = "experiment-churn"
   mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name)
    ```

    ![](./Images/mlflow.png)

1. The code creates an MLflow experiment named `experiment-churn`. Your models will be tracked in this experiment.

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code in it, and run it:

    ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   
   with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()

       model = LogisticRegression(C=1/0.1, solver="liblinear").fit(X_train, y_train)

       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "LogisticRegression")
    ```

    ![](./Images/linear.png)

1. The code trains a classification model using Logistic Regression. Parameters, metrics, and artifacts are automatically logged with MLflow. Additionally, you're logging a parameter called `estimator`, with the value `LogisticRegression`.

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code in it, and run it:

    ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   
   with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()

       model = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)
   
       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "DecisionTreeClassifier")
    ```

    >**Note:** If the node fails, attempt to re-run the previous node and then execute the existing node.

    ![](./Images/tree.png)

1. The code trains a classification model using a Decision Tree Classifier. Parameters, metrics, and artifacts are automatically logged with MLflow. Additionally, you're logging a parameter called `estimator`, with the value `DecisionTreeClassifier`.

## Task 5: Use MLflow to search and view your experiments

   for exp in experiments:
       print(exp.name)
    ```

    ![](./Images/expt5.png)

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code, and run it to retrieve a specific experiment. You can get it by its name:

    ```python
   experiment_name = "experiment-churn"
   exp = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)
   print(exp)
    ```

    ![](./Images/expcrn.png)

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code to use an experiment name, and you can retrieve all jobs of that experiment:

    ```python
   mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id)
    ```

    ![](./Images/idexp.png)

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code to more easily compare job runs and outputs. You can configure the search to order the results. For example, the following cell orders the results by `start_time`, and only shows a maximum of `2` results: 

    ```python
   mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)
    ```

    ![](./Images/timestrt.png)

1. Add a new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code to finally plot the evaluation metrics of multiple models next to each other to easily compare models:

    ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   df_results = mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)[["metrics.training_accuracy_score", "params.estimator"]]
   
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   ax.bar(df_results["params.estimator"], df_results["metrics.training_accuracy_score"])
   ax.set_xlabel("Estimator")
   ax.set_ylabel("Accuracy")
   ax.set_title("Accuracy by Estimator")
   for i, v in enumerate(df_results["metrics.training_accuracy_score"]):
       ax.text(i, v, str(round(v, 2)), ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold')
   plt.show()
    ```

1. The **output** should resemble the following image:
