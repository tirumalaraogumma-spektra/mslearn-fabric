# How to use Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Lab Scenario 

**Contoso Retail** is a global consumer electronics and department store chain operating both physical brick-and-mortar stores and a major e-commerce platform (contoso.com). Currently, Contoso’s sales data is siloed across different platforms: online sales transactions from the website are captured in a cloud-based SQL database, while regional store managers upload daily physical store sales as flat CSV files to an Azure Blob Storage account.

To gain a holistic view of company performance, the Contoso executive team wants a unified analytics platform. As a Data Engineer at Contoso, your task is to build an automated ETL pipeline in Microsoft Fabric. You will use Dataflows (Gen2) to clean the messy physical store files, use Apache Spark Notebooks to handle the high-volume online sales data and perform advanced aggregations, and orchestrate the entire end-to-end process using Fabric Data Pipelines.

## Overview

This lab provides an introduction to Dataflows (Gen2) and Data Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric, focusing on their role in data ingestion, transformation, and automation. Participants will explore how Dataflows (Gen2) connect to various data sources, perform transformations using Power Query Online, and integrate with Data Pipelines to load data into a lakehouse or analytical store. The lab will also cover building and orchestrating pipelines using the Fabric user interface, enabling automation of extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes without extensive coding.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Analyze data with Apache Spark:** You will learn how to use Apache Spark within Microsoft Fabric to explore and analyze large datasets. This task will guide you through creating Spark notebooks, running distributed data processing tasks, and performing data transformations to gain meaningful insights.

- **Create a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric:** You will learn how to create and configure Dataflows (Gen2) to connect to data sources and perform transformations using Power Query Online. This task introduces the core features of Dataflows and demonstrates how they can be used in pipelines or Power BI datasets.

- **Ingest data with a pipeline:** You will learn how to build data pipelines to ingest data from external sources into a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric. This includes using Apache Spark to apply custom transformations before loading the data for analysis.

## Pre-requisites

- Foundational understanding of Microsoft Fabric and its core components
- Familiarity with data ingestion and transformation concepts
- Basic knowledge of Power Query and its role in data preparation

## Architecture

The architecture of this lab revolves around Microsoft Fabric’s Dataflows (Gen2) and Data Pipelines, forming a seamless framework for data ingestion, transformation, and automation. Dataflows (Gen2) serve as the entry point, connecting to diverse data sources and leveraging Power Query Online for data transformation. These transformed datasets integrate with Data Pipelines, which orchestrate data movement into a lakehouse or analytical store. The Fabric user interface facilitates pipeline construction and automation, streamlining extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflows without requiring extensive coding, thereby enhancing efficiency and scalability in data processing.

## Explanation of Components

- **Lakehouse:** The lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric provides a unified data architecture that combines the scalability of a data lake with the relational capabilities of a data warehouse. It serves as the central storage layer for both raw and processed data, supporting analytics and reporting.

- **Notebook:** Notebooks offer an interactive environment for data exploration and transformation using Apache Spark. They enable users to write code, execute queries, visualize results, and perform advanced analytics directly within Fabric.

- **Dataflow (Gen2):** Dataflows (Gen2) are a low-code data preparation tool designed to ingest, clean, and transform data from various sources. They can be connected to destinations such as lakehouses and integrated into pipelines for streamlined processing.

- **Pipeline:** Pipelines provide orchestration and automation of data workflows in Fabric. They integrate activities such as notebooks and dataflows into a sequence, enabling end-to-end automation of ingestion, transformation, and analysis processes.
