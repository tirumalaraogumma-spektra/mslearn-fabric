# Exercise 3: Ingest data with a pipeline

### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Lab Scenario 

Now that you have mastered independent data ingestion using Spark and Dataflows, you need to build an automated, enterprise-grade architecture for Contoso Retail. The executive team wants a single, hands-free workflow that pulls fresh, raw daily sales logs from external cloud storage directly into the lakehouse.

Because this process must happen sequentially and reliably every day, you cannot run these tasks manually.

In this exercise, you will build a Fabric Data Pipeline to automate the end-to-end ingestion process. You will construct a workflow that copies raw operational data into OneLake storage, trigger an Apache Spark Notebook to automatically handle complex transformations, and modify the pipeline to ensure the entire ETL sequence runs seamlessly from start to finish.

## Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to ingest data into a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse using pipelines. You will implement ETL/ELT processes by building a pipeline that copies data from external sources into OneLake storage and leverages Apache Spark to transform and load it into structured tables for analysis—an essential skill for scalable cloud-based analytics solutions.

## Lab Objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

 - Task 1: Create a pipeline
 - Task 2: Create a notebook
 - Task 3: Modify the pipeline

## Task 1: Create a pipeline

In this task, you will create a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric to ingest data into your lakehouse. You will use the Copy Data activity to extract data from a source and copy it into a subfolder within the lakehouse, forming the foundation for an ETL or ELT process.

1. From the left pane, click on **My workspace (1)**, then select the **fabric-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** workspace.

## Task 2: Create a notebook

In this task, you will create a notebook in Microsoft Fabric to begin processing your ingested data using PySpark. You will write code to load sales data, apply transformations, and save the results as a table in the lakehouse enabling further analysis or reporting through SQL or visualization tools.

1. From the lakehouse Home page, select **Analyze data with (1)** dropdown and select **Notebook (2)** option under that choose **New notebook** after it takes you to notebook page view with default notebook cell.

    ![](./Images2/3/e3-notebook-option.png)

1. Select the existing cell in the notebook, replace the default code with the following **code (1)** and click on **&#9655; Run (2)**.

    ```python
   table_name = "sales"
    ```

    ![](./Images2/3/t2-2.png)

1. In the notebook cell, click the **ellipsis (...) (1)** menu from the top-right corner of the cell, then select **Toggle parameter cell (2)** to set the cell’s variables as parameters for pipeline runs.

    ![](./Images2/3/t2-3.png)

1. Under the parameters cell, hover the mouse and use the **+ Code** button to add a new code cell. Then add the following code to it:

    ![](./Images2/3/t2-4.png)

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import *
    
    # Read the new sales data
    df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","true").option("inferSchema","true").load("Files/new_data/*.csv")

    ## Add month and year columns
    df = df.withColumn("Year", year(col("OrderDate"))).withColumn("Month", month(col("OrderDate")))

    # Derive FirstName and LastName columns
    df = df.withColumn("FirstName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(0)).withColumn("LastName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(1))

    # Filter and reorder columns
    df = df["SalesOrderNumber", "SalesOrderLineNumber", "OrderDate", "Year", "Month", "FirstName", "LastName", "EmailAddress", "Item", "Quantity", "UnitPrice", "TaxAmount"]

    # Load the data into a managed table
    #Managed tables are tables for which both the schema metadata and the data files are managed by Fabric. The data files for the table are created in the Tables folder.
    df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(table_name)
    ```

    This code loads data from the ingested **sales.csv** file, applies transformations, and saves it as a **managed table**, appending if the table already exists.

1. Verify your notebook matches the example and click **&#9655; Run all** on the toolbar to execute all cells.

    ![](./Images2/3/t2-5.png)

    > **Note:** Since this is the first time you've run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first cell can take a minute or so to complete.

1. After the notebook run completes, from the left pane, click on **My workspace (1)**, then select **fabric_lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** to open.

     ![](./Images2/lab4-11-4.png)

1. In the **Explorer** pane, expand **Tables**, click the **ellipsis (...) (1)** next to it, and select **Refresh (2)** to verify that the **sales** table has been created successfully.

     ![](./Images2/lab4-11-6.png)

     ![](./Images2/lab4-11-7.png)

1. From the left pane, click on **My workspace (1)**, then select **Notebook 1 (2)**.

     ![](./Images2/lab4-11-9.png)

## Task 3: Modify the pipeline

In this task, you will modify your existing pipeline to include the notebook you created for data transformation. By integrating the notebook into the pipeline, you will build a reusable and automated ETL process that extracts data, runs Spark-based transformations, and loads the results into a lakehouse table.

1. From the left pane, click on **My workspace (1)**, then select the previously created **Ingest Sales Data pipeline (2)** to proceed.

     ![](./Images2/lab4-11-10.png)

2. From the **Activities (1)** tab, click the **ellipsis (...)

        - From the **Choose a data source to get started** window, select **fabric_lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

          ![](./Images2/lab4-11-12.png)

        - Once connected, configure the following:
            - **File path type**: Wildcard file path **(1)**
            - **Folder path**: new_data **(2)**
            - **Wildcard file name**: *.csv **(3)**    
            - **Recursively**: Selected **(4)**

                ![](./Images2/lab4-11-13.png)

    - **Logging settings (1)**:
        - **Enable logging**: *Unselected* **(2)**

          ![](./Images2/3/t3-3c.png)

    These settings will ensure that any existing .csv files are deleted before copying the **sales.csv** file.

4. In the pipeline designer, navigate to the **Activities (1)** tab and select the **Notebook (2)** to add it to the pipeline.

    ![](./Images2/3/t3-4.png)
